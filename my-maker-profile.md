## 💡 My Project Idea | 我的项目想法

### Project Name (if you have one) | 项目名称（如果你有的话）

**Smart Air Quality Monitor** (智能空气质量监测器)

### What do I want to make? | 我想做什么？

*Describe your project idea in 3-5 sentences*  
*用 3-5 句话描述你的项目想法*

I want to build a smart air quality monitor that tracks CO2, PM2.5, temperature, and humidity levels in my workspace. The device will display real-time data on a small OLED screen and change LED colors based on air quality (green = good, yellow = moderate, red = poor). It will also log data to the cloud so I can track patterns over time and receive phone notifications when air quality drops below healthy levels. The goal is to help me remember to open windows and take breaks at the right times.

我想制作一个智能空气质量监测器，追踪我工作空间的 CO2、PM2.5、温度和湿度水平。设备将在小型 OLED 屏幕上显示实时数据，并根据空气质量改变 LED 颜色（绿色=良好，黄色=中等，红色=差）。它还会将数据记录到云端，这样我可以追踪长期模式，并在空气质量低于健康水平时收到手机通知。目标是帮助我记得在正确的时间开窗和休息。

### Why do I want to make this? | 为什么想做这个？

*What problem does it solve? What excites you about it?*  
*它解决什么问题？什么让你对它感到兴奋？*

As someone who works from home, I often forget to ventilate my room and end up feeling sluggish and unproductive. I've noticed that my concentration drops significantly in stuffy environments, but I don't always notice when the air quality has gotten bad. This project excites me because it combines hardware sensors, data visualization, and cloud connectivity - all skills I want to learn. Plus, it's immediately useful and will improve my daily life!

作为一个在家工作的人，我经常忘记给房间通风，最终感到疲惫和低效。我注意到在闷热的环境中，我的注意力会显著下降，但我并不总是注意到空气质量变差了。这个项目让我兴奋，因为它结合了硬件传感器、数据可视化和云连接 - 这些都是我想学习的技能。而且，它立即有用，会改善我的日常生活！

### What technologies or tools might I need? | 我可能需要什么技术或工具？

*It's okay if you're not sure yet!*  
*如果你还不确定，没关系！*

- [x] Arduino
- [x] ESP32 (for WiFi connectivity)
- [x] Sensors (which ones?: CO2 sensor (MQ-135), PM2.5 sensor (PMS5003), BME280 for temp/humidity)
- [x] LEDs / Lights (RGB LED for status indication)
- [ ] Motors / Servos
- [ ] 3D Printing (maybe for a custom enclosure)
- [ ] AI / Machine Learning (could use ML to predict air quality trends)
- [x] Other: OLED display, cloud platform (ThingSpeak or Firebase), mobile app integration

### One specific thing I want to master | 我想掌握的一件具体事情

I want to master the art of debugging hardware projects - specifically, learning how to systematically troubleshoot when things don't work. I've noticed that I often give up too quickly when a circuit doesn't work on the first try. I want to learn how to use a multimeter effectively, read datasheets confidently, and develop a methodical approach to finding and fixing problems.

## 🌟 My Maker Identity | 我的 Maker 身份

### Which Maker principle resonates with me most? | 哪个 Maker 原则最能引起我的共鸣？

*Choose one from: Curiosity, Hands-on, Fail Fast, Iteration, Interdisciplinary, Open Sharing*  
*从以下选择一个：好奇、动手、快速试错、迭代、跨学科、开源分享*

**I choose | 我选择**: **Fail Fast (快速试错)**

**Because | 因为**: 

I've realized that my biggest obstacle to making things has been the fear of failure. I spend so much time planning and researching, trying to make everything perfect before I start, that I often never actually build anything. The "Fail Fast" principle resonates with me because it gives me permission to try things even when I'm not 100% sure they'll work.

I love the idea that每个失败都是一个学习机会 (every failure is a learning opportunity). In software development, I can iterate quickly because testing is easy. But with hardware, I've been intimidated by the cost of components and the time it takes to assemble things. This course is helping me realize that rapid prototyping and iteration is actually MORE efficient than trying to get everything perfect on the first try. I want to embrace the mindset that "done is better than perfect" and that breaking things is a feature, not a bug!

我意识到我制作东西的最大障碍是对失败的恐惧。我花太多时间规划和研究，试图在开始之前让一切完美，以至于我经常实际上什么都没做。"快速试错"原则引起我的共鸣，因为它允许我即使不是100%确定会成功也可以尝试。我喜欢每个失败都是学习机会的想法。在软件开发中，我可以快速迭代因为测试很容易。但在硬件方面，我一直被组件的成本和组装事物所需的时间所吓倒。这个课程帮助我意识到快速原型和迭代实际上比试图第一次就把一切做得完美更有效率。我想接受"完成比完美更好"的心态，打破东西是一个特性，而不是错误！

## 🎯 My 6-Day Goals | 我的 6 天目标

### What does success look like for me at the end of this course? | 课程结束时，成功对我来说是什么样的？

Success for me means having one fully functional prototype that I can demonstrate to others, with complete documentation that would allow someone else to replicate it. More importantly, success means feeling confident enough to tackle my next project independently, without needing a course or instructor to guide me. I want to have internalized the maker mindset and developed problem-solving skills that I can apply to any future project.

### Specific goals for each day | 每天的具体目标

- **Day 1**: Complete maker profile, understand the maker mindset, successfully use Git/GitHub for version control
- **Day 2**: Set up my development environment, get my first sensor reading, document my learning process
- **Day 3**: Integrate multiple sensors, display data on screen, troubleshoot at least one hardware problem independently
- **Day 4**: Implement cloud connectivity, visualize data on a dashboard, begin 3D modeling for enclosure
- **Day 5**: Complete MVP (minimum viable product), test with real usage, identify improvement opportunities
- **Day 6**: Finalize project, create comprehensive documentation, prepare presentation, help at least one classmate with their project

## 💬 Additional Thoughts | 其他想法

### Is there anything else you'd like to share? | 还有什么想分享的吗？

I'm really excited about the collaborative aspect of this course! I learn best when I can see how others approach problems and when I can explain my own思考过程 (thinking process) to others. I'm hoping to find potential collaborators for future projects beyond this course.

### Any concerns or questions? | 有任何顾虑或问题吗？

My main concern is time management - I have a full-time job and I'm worried about falling behind if something takes longer than expected. I'm planning to dedicate at least 2-3 hours each evening to the course work, and I have my weekends mostly free. I might need help prioritizing if I feel overwhelmed!

另外，我对焊接有点紧张。我从来没有焊接过，担心会损坏组件。希望能得到一些指导和练习机会。
