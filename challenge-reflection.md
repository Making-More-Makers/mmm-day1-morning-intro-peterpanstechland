### Our Team Dynamics | 我们的团队动态

**Who took the leadership role? | 谁担任了领导角色？**

I naturally took on the initial design role, but Lisa quickly became our de facto leader during the building phase because she had the steadiest hands and best spatial awareness. Leadership shifted organically based on what phase we were in.

**How did we divide the work? | 我们如何分工？**

- Peter: Initial design concepts and structure planning
- Lisa: Main builder, hands-on assembly
- Mike: Time management, calling out milestones (3 min, 6 min, 9 min, etc.)
- Sarah: Continuous testing - she tested stability after every modification

**Did everyone contribute equally? | 每个人的贡献是否平等？**

Yes! Even though we had different roles, everyone contributed equally. Mike's time management was crucial - without his constant updates, we would have run out of time. Sarah's testing saved us from several potential collapses.

## ✅ What Worked Well | 什么做得好

### Successful Strategies | 成功的策略

**What was our initial strategy? | 我们最初的策略是什么？**

Our strategy was to build a wide triangular base first, then build upward with vertical supports, and only add the marshmallow in the last 30 seconds. We decided early on to use double strands of spaghetti for vertical supports to increase strength.

**What worked better than expected? | 什么比预期的效果更好？**

The wide triangular base (about 20cm per side) worked AMAZINGLY well! It was so stable that we could actually shake the table slightly and the structure wouldn't fall. Also, using tape to create small "joints" at connection points gave us much more flexibility than just breaking spaghetti.

**What would you do the same way if you did it again? | 如果再做一次，你会用同样的方法做什么？**

Definitely the wide base and the "test early, test often" approach. Sarah tested our structure every 2-3 minutes, which gave us time to fix problems before they became critical. Also, saving the marshmallow for last was genius!

## ❌ What Failed | 什么失败了

### Challenges We Faced | 我们面临的挑战

**What didn't work as planned? | 什么没有按计划进行？**

Our first attempt at building vertically failed spectacularly! We tried to build straight up from the center of the triangle, but around 30cm it started to lean like the Tower of Pisa. We had to tear it down and start the vertical section over.

**Why do you think it failed? | 你认为为什么失败了？**

The spaghetti strands weren't perfectly aligned, so as we built higher, small angle errors accumulated and caused the lean. Also, we didn't account for the weight distribution - the center of gravity shifted as we built up.

**What was the biggest challenge? | 最大的挑战是什么？**

Time pressure! At the 10-minute mark, when we had to tear down our vertical section and rebuild, panic set in. Mike helped us stay calm by reminding us we still had 8 minutes, which was plenty of time if we stayed focused.

## 🔄 Iterations | 迭代

### How We Adapted | 我们如何适应

**How many different designs did we try? | 我们尝试了多少种不同的设计？**

☐ 1  ☑ 2-3  ☐ 4-5  ☐ 6+

**Describe one major change we made during the challenge | 描述我们在挑战中做出的一个重大改变**

After our first vertical tower leaned and nearly collapsed, we changed our approach completely. Instead of a single central tower, we built THREE vertical supports from the three corners of the triangle base, then connected them at the top to create a stable platform for the marshmallow. This tripod-like structure was much more stable!

**Did testing early help us? | 早期测试对我们有帮助吗？**

Absolutely! Sarah's constant testing caught two near-disasters: once when a tape joint was peeling, and once when we had too much weight on one side. Each time, we fixed it immediately rather than discovering it during final measurement. Testing early was our secret weapon!

## 🤝 Teamwork Lessons | 团队合作的经验

### What We Learned About Collaboration | 我们从协作中学到了什么

**What worked well in our team communication? | 我们团队沟通中什么做得好？**

We developed a quick feedback system: Sarah would say "testing" before touching the structure, and everyone would freeze and watch. This prevented accidental bumps during critical tests. We also celebrated small wins - every time we added 5cm, we'd do a quick fist bump!

**What could we have done better as a team? | 作为一个团队，我们可以做得更好的是什么？**

In the first 5 minutes, we all talked at once with competing ideas. It was chaotic! We could have spent 1 minute at the start to align on our strategy before diving in. Also, we should have designated someone to watch other teams for ideas - we were so focused on our own structure that we didn't learn from others.

**How did we handle disagreements? | 我们如何处理分歧？**

When Lisa and I disagreed about whether to use string or tape for joints, Sarah suggested "let's test both!" We spent 30 seconds testing each method on small samples and tape clearly won. Data-driven decisions resolved our conflict immediately!

**Did we listen to everyone's ideas? | 我们有听取每个人的想法吗？**

Yes, mostly! But I admit I was a bit pushy with my initial design idea. Lisa had to basically say "Peter, stop talking and let's try Sarah's idea" to get me to listen. After that worked better, I learned to be more open to others' suggestions. Lesson learned: being a "maker" means being humble enough to try other people's ideas!

## ⏱️ Time Management | 时间管理

### How We Used Our 18 Minutes | 我们如何使用 18 分钟

**How much time did we spend planning vs. building? | 我们花了多少时间规划 vs. 建造？**

Planning | 规划: 2 minutes  
Building | 建造: 16 minutes

**Did we have time left over or run out of time? | 我们有剩余时间还是时间不够？**

We finished with about 1 minute to spare, which we used to do a final stability check and make small adjustments. Perfect timing thanks to Mike's constant updates!

**Was our time management effective? | 我们的时间管理有效吗？**

Very effective! Mike's role as timekeeper was crucial. He called out time every 3 minutes and gave us a "5 minutes left" and "2 minutes left" warning. The only thing we could improve would be starting to plan where the marshmallow goes earlier - we only figured that out in the last 2 minutes.

## 🔧 Engineering Thinking | 工程思维

### Design Process | 设计过程

**Did we test our structure before the final measurement? | 我们在最终测量前测试我们的结构了吗？**

☑ Yes, multiple times  
☐ Yes, once or twice  
☐ No, we ran out of time  
☐ No, we didn't think to test it

**What would we change if we had 5 more minutes? | 如果我们还有 5 分钟，我们会改变什么？**

We'd add cross-bracing between the three vertical supports to make it even more stable. We also noticed that other teams used string to create tension supports - we'd explore that technique if we had more time.

**What engineering principles did we discover? | 我们发现了什么工程原理？**

- **Triangles are stable**: Our triangular base was rock solid
- **Wide base = stability**: The wider the base, the higher we could build
- **Weight distribution matters**: The marshmallow is heavy! We needed to plan for its weight from the start
- **Redundancy is good**: Three vertical supports were better than one thick one
- **Testing reveals truth**: You can't predict stability by looking - you have to test!
- **Iteration beats perfection**: Our second design (after the rebuild) was much better than trying to get it perfect the first time

## 🎓 Lessons Learned | 学到的经验

### Key Takeaways | 关键收获

**The most important thing I learned from this challenge | 我从这个挑战中学到的最重要的事情**

Fail fast, iterate quickly! Our first vertical tower failed, but instead of seeing it as a disaster, we saw it as valuable data. The failure taught us what NOT to do, and our second iteration was much better. This is exactly how real engineering and making works - you learn more from failures than from successes.

**One thing I would definitely do differently next time | 下次我肯定会做得不同的一件事**

I'd be less attached to my initial design. I wasted probably 2 minutes trying to convince the team that my idea was "the right way" before I was willing to listen to alternatives. Next time, I'll propose ideas more lightly and be quicker to pivot when something isn't working.

**How does this challenge relate to real maker projects? | 这个挑战如何与真实的创客项目相关？**

This challenge IS real maker projects, just compressed into 18 minutes! Everything was there:
- **Constraints**: Limited materials (20 spaghetti, 1 marshmallow, limited tape/string)
- **Time pressure**: Real projects have deadlines too
- **Iteration**: Build, test, learn, rebuild
- **Teamwork**: Different skills complement each other
- **Unexpected failures**: Things that should work don't always work
- **Problem-solving under pressure**: The best solutions often come when you're forced to think fast

The only difference is scale and time - real projects take days/weeks instead of minutes, but the process is identical!

## 🌟 Maker Mindset Connection | Maker 思维的联系

### How the Challenge Embodies Maker Principles | 挑战如何体现 Maker 原则

**Curiosity | 好奇**: How did we explore different possibilities?  
我们如何探索不同的可能性？

We wondered "what if we use three supports instead of one?" and "what happens if we make the base twice as wide?" Every question led to a mini-experiment. Curiosity drove us to try things rather than just theorize.

**Hands-on | 动手**: How did building teach us more than just thinking?  
建造如何比仅仅思考教会我们更多？

We could have spent all 18 minutes planning the "perfect" structure, but we would have learned nothing. By building and touching the materials, we discovered properties we couldn't predict - like how spaghetti bends before breaking, or how tape creates flexible joints. You can't learn these things from thinking alone!

**Fail Fast | 快速试错**: How many times did we fail and try again?  
我们失败了多少次并再次尝试？

At least 5 times! The leaning tower, several joint failures, two testing failures, and many small adjustments. Each failure took less than a minute to recognize and fix because we were testing constantly. Failing fast meant we had time to recover.

**Iteration | 迭代**: How did we improve our design step by step?  
我们如何一步步改进我们的设计？

Base → vertical tower (failed) → three-support system → added cross-bracing → adjusted marshmallow placement. Each step built on lessons from the previous one. We didn't try to get it perfect; we tried to get it better.

**Interdisciplinary | 跨学科**: What different skills did our team bring?  
我们的团队带来了哪些不同的技能？

Peter (me): Physics/engineering mindset for structural design  
Lisa: Fine motor skills and spatial reasoning  
Mike: Project management and time awareness  
Sarah: Quality assurance and systematic testing

None of us could have succeeded alone! Our different backgrounds made us stronger.

**Open Sharing | 开源分享**: Did we look at other teams' approaches?  
我们有观察其他团队的方法吗？

Not enough! We were so focused on our own work that we didn't look around until near the end. We noticed one team using string in a really clever way - wish we'd seen that earlier! In retrospect, "stealing ideas" is actually "learning from the community" and we should have done more of it.

## 🚀 Moving Forward | 展望未来

### Applying This to My Project | 将这应用到我的项目

**How will today's experience help with my maker project? | 今天的经历将如何帮助我的创客项目？**

For my Smart Air Quality Monitor project, I'll apply these lessons:
1. **Build a minimal prototype first** - Just get ONE sensor working before adding all five
2. **Test continuously** - Don't wait until everything is assembled to power it on
3. **Expect and embrace failures** - My first circuit probably won't work, and that's okay!
4. **Time-box my planning** - Spend 10% planning, 90% building and iterating
5. **Document failures** - They're as valuable as successes

**What team skills do I want to develop more? | 我想更多发展哪些团队技能？**

- **Active listening**: Really hearing others' ideas before pushing my own
- **Constructive feedback**: How to say "I don't think that will work" without shutting people down
- **Celebrating others' wins**: I realized I was so focused on my ideas that I didn't celebrate when Lisa's techniques worked

**What would I do differently in my final project based on this experience? | 根据这次经历，我在最终项目中会做什么不同的事？**

I'll create explicit test milestones: "By day 2, sensor readings work. By day 3, display works. By day 4, cloud connection works." Just like how we tested our tower every 2-3 minutes, I'll test my project at each milestone rather than waiting until the end.

## 💬 Personal Reflection | 个人反思

### How I Felt | 我的感受

**What was the most frustrating moment? | 最令人沮丧的时刻是什么？**

When our beautiful vertical tower started leaning at the 10-minute mark. We'd invested so much effort and it just wasn't working! For about 30 seconds, I wanted to give up. But then Lisa said "okay, new plan!" with such energy that it snapped me out of my disappointment.

**What was the most exciting moment? | 最激动人心的时刻是什么？**

The final measurement! When the instructor measured our tower and announced "45 centimeters - and it's stable!" we all high-fived. Even more exciting was seeing that other teams respected our three-support design - it felt good to contribute something innovative to the class.

**Did I surprise myself in any way? | 我有没有在某方面让自己惊讶？**

Yes! I surprised myself with how quickly I bounced back from our failure. Usually, I get really discouraged when things don't work. But in this challenge, there was no time for discouragement - we just had to try again. I realized that time pressure can actually be helpful because it forces you to move forward instead of dwelling on failures.

**On a scale of 1-10, how much fun did I have? | 按 1-10 的标度，我玩得有多开心？**

☐ 1 ☐ 2 ☐ 3 ☐ 4 ☐ 5 ☐ 6 ☐ 7 ☐ 8 ☑ 9 ☐ 10

(Would have been 10 if we'd gotten first place! 😄 But seriously, it was incredibly fun.)
